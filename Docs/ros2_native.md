# ROS2 native interface

The CARLA simulator supports ROS2 natively from the server. Launch CARLA from the command line with the `--ros2` command line option:

```sh
./CarlaUnreal.sh --ros2
```

The CARLA server will broadcast sensor data for any spawned sensors for which ROS is enabled. To enable a sensor for ROS use the `enable_for_ros()` method of the sensor class:

```py
sensor = world.spawn_actor(sensor_blueprint, transform)
sensor.enable_for_ros()
```

Set the ROS topic name in the sensor blueprint prior to spawning (a random string name will be generated by default):

```py
bp = bp_lib.find('sensor.camera.rgb')
bp.set_attribute('ros_name', 'front_camera')
```

In this case the image data will be published to: `/carla/front_camera/image`. 

If the camera is parented to an actor, for example the ego vehicle, the topic name will also include the role name given to the vehicle: `/carla/ego/front_camera/image`.

## Control data

Controls may be sent to one ego vehicle:

```py
bp = bp.find("vehicle.lincoln.mkz_2020")
bp.set_attribute("ros_name", "ego")

ego = carla.spawn_actor(bp, spawn_point)
```

When the ego vehicle is spawned a subscriber will be created with ROS topic name: `/carla/ego/vehicle_control_cmd`. 

## CarlaEgoVehicleControl.msg

To send control messages, install the [ros-carla-msgs ROS package](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-carla-msgs/tree/master). The control message has the following fields:
